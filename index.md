## Size
Because complexity is often correlated with the size of operations, we typically partner with larger organizations. However, we have found complexity to exist across all company sizes, so we have partnerships with smaller companies too where a reasonable amount of optimization potential exists.

## Location
We greatly value spending time at client sites to get to know complex operations. For this reason, most of our partners are North American, since we are a Canadian company. We have satelite offices that assist in serving the rest of our global partners mainly across Europe and Africa.
